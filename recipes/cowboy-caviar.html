    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cowboy caviar, also called Texas caviar, is a refreshing salad of black-eyed peas and other ingredients tossed in a vinaigrette dressing.</p>
    <p>It was invented in 1940 by Helen Corbitt in Texas. Corbitt, who later became the food service director for the Zodiac Room at Neiman Marcus in Dallas, first served the dish on New Year's Eve at the Houston Country Club.</p>
    <p>So why is it called "cowboy caviar?" The dish got its tongue-in-cheek name when Corbitt served it at the Driskill Hotel in Austin — it's meant to be a funny comparison to true caviar, which is much more expensive and difficult to come by.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (15.5 ounce) can black beans, drained</li>
        <li>1 (15.5 ounce) can black-eyed peas, drained</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained</li>
        <li>2 cups frozen corn kernels, thawed</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, diced</li>
        <li>1/4 medium green bell pepper, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped pickled jalapeno peppers</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 cup Italian salad dressing</li>
        <li>3/4 cup chopped cilantro</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix black beans, black-eyed peas, diced tomatoes, corn, onion, bell pepper, and jalapeño peppers together in a large bowl. Season with garlic salt, then pour in Italian salad dressing and add cilantro. Mix until well coated.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate until flavors have melded, at least 20 minutes or up to 3 days, before serving.</li>
    </ol>
